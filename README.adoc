=== HTML Diff

==== Decision

For the time being, we will not use a diff library.

There are several javascript based diff libraries available.
However, most of them only diff the text, not the styles.
https://github.com/dfoverdx/htmldiff-js[htmldiff-js] is capable of diffing also the styles.
We gave it a try but the diff is not good enough.

Hint: we used browserify to use the node module.
