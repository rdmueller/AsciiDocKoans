== Introduction

Welcome to the AsciiDoc-Koans.
This collection of tasks will walk you through the most important features of AsciiDoc.
For each task, the is a paragraph given which you should meditate on and try to rebuild with your AsciiDoc knowledge.

Here is an example:

=== Basic Formattings

The following include statement fetches the target paragraph which you should re-build with your AsciiDoc knowledge.
On the left sie of your editor window, you will see it as `include`-statement, while on the right -- the preview -- you will see it rendered.

include::solutions/00_test.adoc[tag=01]

Now, here is the same paragraph without the bold and italics formatting.
Try to apply the correct formatting (hint: look at the menu above the source code window image:images/file.png[width=60]) to turn it green:

[.input]
Some basic formattings are bold and italics.

Great! So let's go a bit further...

If you are stuck and want to reveal the solution, kbd:[ctrl]-click the include file to see it.

=== Sentences and Paragraphs

Sentences and paragraphs are really important to understand.

include::solutions/00_test.adoc[tag=04]

This is already green, because there is nothing special.

[.input]
--
Two sentences across several lines.
They are all displayed as one paragraph.
--

But you should get used to it.
Two sentences on seperate lines will be shown as one paragraph.
The line break is not visible in the output.

Use it to format your text one sentence (or half-sentence if you tend to create longer ones) per line.
This will result in nicer diffs when you put your documentation under vresion control.

Now, how do you create two paragraphs?

include::solutions/00_test.adoc[tag=05]

[.input]
--
Two sentences displayed as two paragraphs.
The additional space between them shows visually that they are distinct.
--

And if you want to add an extra line break without a new paragraph?

include::solutions/00_test.adoc[tag=06]

TIP: here are two extra line breaks hidden
[.input]
--
Sometimes you don't want a new paragraph but just a new line.
The space between these two lines is just if there was an automatic break within a paragraph.
--


=== Bonus: Strike through and highlight

Bold and italic of often already enough for most documents.
The following two examples show that even more is possible.

include::solutions/00_test.adoc[tag=02]

[.input]
Some advanced formatting is strike through.

include::solutions/00_test.adoc[tag=03]

[.input]
And you can even highlight some text.

The strike through example gives an advanced look behind the scenes of advanced formattings.
The `line-through` in `[.line-through]\#strike through#` is just the name of a class for the following text.
This allows you to create your own styles.
